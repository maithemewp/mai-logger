## [0.2.0] - unreleased

0.1.3 was never tagged. This release replaces its version negotiation with the loader, and includes its other fixes, listed below.

### Changed

- **Loaded by [maithemewp/mai-package-loader](https://github.com/maithemewp/mai-package-loader)**, through a `mai-package.php` declaration, instead of this package's own bootstrap. `init.php` and `Mai_Logger_Bootstrap` are gone. Requires `maithemewp/mai-package-loader` `^0.1`.
- **Needs PHP 8.1**, up from 7.4, because the loader does. Every plugin bundling mai-logger already requires 8.1 or later: mai-analytics 8.1, the rest 8.2.

### Fixed

- **The newest copy now loads.** Composer runs a package's `files` entry only once per request, so only the first plugin's bootstrap ever registered. Older copies keep working beside this one: the loader answers first. `tests/coexistence.sh` proves it against a 0.1.2 copy.

## [0.1.3] - never tagged, included in 0.2.0

### Fixed

- *Replaced in 0.2.0 by mai-package-loader.* Version negotiation picked the first plugin to load, not the newest copy, because Composer includes a package's `init.php` once per request. 0.1.3 fixed it in its own bootstrap; 0.2.0 removes the bootstrap instead.
- *Replaced in 0.2.0, which has no `init.php`.* `init.php` registered version `0.1.1` while the class was `0.1.2`.
- The docs said `error()` always reaches `debug.log`. It only does when `WP_DEBUG_LOG` is on, which is the intended behaviour. The method docblocks and the README now say so. No behaviour changed.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-07-08

### Changed

- Added a `.gitattributes` with `export-ignore` so dev-only paths are stripped from the Composer dist archive (preventive; the package currently ships only its PHP sources).

## [0.1.1] - 2026-07-06

### Fixed

- Allow the class to load under CLI (PHPUnit) without `ABSPATH` defined, so a bundling plugin can run its test suite on a clean checkout or in CI. Added `@param`/`@return` docblocks across the public methods.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-04-27

### Added

- Initial release. `Mai_Logger`, a lightweight logger for WordPress plugins, loaded via a bootstrap autoloader that selects the newest registered version across all installed plugins.
